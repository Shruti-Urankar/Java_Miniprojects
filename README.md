**Overview**
This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides hints on whether the actual number is higher or lower. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.

**How It Works**
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The player is prompted to enter their guess.
If the guess is correct, the game prints "Correct! You Win!" and exits.
If the guess is too low, the game prints "Nope! The number is higher. Guess again."
If the guess is too high, the game prints "Nope! The number is lower. Guess again."
The process repeats until the correct number is guessed.
